The goal of this model is to study the different modes of cell migration and to predict means to block it by considering not only spatial information obtained from the agent-based simulation but also intracellular regulation obtained from the Boolean model.


## Manuscript

The first version of this model was published in [Multiscale model of the different modes of cancer cell invasion, *Bioinformatics*, June 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad374). A follow up version was published in the PhysiBoSS tutorial [Building multiscale models with PhysiBoSS, an agent-based modeling tool, *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, November 2024](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbae509).
